Merry Christmas. But fuck I'm finding it hard to put my time to any constructive use. I wanted to write this post
as a means of doing something, anything, productive. But I need to start writing, or drawing, or something. Maybe
I'll start tomorrow. Maybe tonight the ghost of Christmas past will come and beat me till I want it enough.
