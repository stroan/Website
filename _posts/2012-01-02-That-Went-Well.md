Today was a productive day. Bought some fancy new clothes for a hot date I have coming up. Gonna be the belle of the ball for sure. I also cooked a tasty meal, scampi sushi rolls with sweet chilli sauce. It was delicious but there are improvements to be made. Packed the roll too tightly, rice wasn't sticky enough, didn't seal it properly, and my kingdom for a sharp knife with which to cut the roll. The rice keeps very well with the vinegar folded into it so I may start making that the night before and wrap up a roll in the morning to cut and eat for lunch.

But far more important than clothing and feeding myself was the artings. That went very well. A half an hour of drawing poses using [this wonderful thing](http://www.pixelovely.com/gesture/figuredrawing.php). I found it on [r/learnart](http://reddit.com/r/learnart/) a while ago but this was my first time using it. I did far more poses today in a half hour than I have in weeks. I don't think I should do it every day though. I'm thinking of alternating drawing poses and anatomy studies for now.

The writing went surprisingly well too. Writing isn't something I've put much time into in a very long time. But I want a slightly more creative outlet while I work on the technical skills involved in drawing. Another subreddit to the rescue, this time [r/promptoftheday](http://www.reddit.com/r/promptoftheday). I'm looking forward to doing this again tomorrow. The writing was fun enough that I wanted to write this post as an excuse to keep on writing.

The prompt today was to write the thoughts of a character as they fall asleep. I wanted to write from the perspective of someone who was surviving in the aftermath of a nuclear war, and to try to explain as much about the situation as I could without being overtly expository.

**A Winter Night**

My feet are freezing. Goerge has socks. I still have some cigarettes from before, I wonder how many I'd have to give him for a pair. No, Cathie    wouldn't agree to that. She's right too. Lord, she's asleep already. How does she do it so easilly. She'll get annoyed if I mention it though. She really misses the old place, but this is better than nothing. I miss it too. We don't have much left though, we can't afford to sleep like this any more. 

They're at it again, at this hour! I wish Frank and Mary hadn't requested to be moved closer to their daughter. Those kids who got assigned their old room; I bet they're the ones who took the carrots last week, it was just after they moved in. I haven't seen either of them at the employment office either. They probably wait till the block is empty and then riffle through our stuff. Oh, if I caught that guy in here, digging under the matress... I'm sure the old reliables would love to help. Sure Steve's been steaming since someone took that box of raisins.

We need to look after our own.
