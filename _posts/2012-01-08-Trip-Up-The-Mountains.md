Spent the weekend in a swanky hotel in the Wicklow mountains. It was a work trip, and very enjoyable. There was an old unused church behind the hotel. It had been intended to be where weddings at the hotel could be performed but the church had refused to consecrate the land. Instead a new, less pretty, church was constructed which they were willing to consecrate. Seems a pity, but I did get to take some nice pictures of an old building. Also, I went mad with filters.

Back down to drawing now. Another load of poses I think, and then I'll read the Loomis book in the evening afterwards.
