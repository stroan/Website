I'm getting close to putting a fork in version 1 of Lamn. There's a good chunk of work left to do to get things to that point, but it's at least visible on the horizon. The last major feature I'm working on is some bare bones debugging functionality, probably nothing more than pulling stack traces programaticaly in code. After that I need to plough through the busy work of hooking up all the operators, meta-methods, etc. All work that has been done for one or two sample cases and just needs some time.

But not tonight. And probably not tomorrow. I have new books to read: Hellboy volume 3, X-Factor volume 5, and House of M. I'm so glad to have discovered comics again, after so long without them.

It's only recently that I've became aware of comics that were interesting for more reasons than the action, T&A, and pretty pictures. I read Watchmen when I was in my mid-teens, and followed Uncanny X-Men when I could. Later I read a few volumes of Sandman, V for Vendetta and Maus. I thought there was some fundamental difference between the long running serials like X-Men, and those more meritous works that got repackaged as graphic novels.

Transmetropolitan bridged that gap. It was long enough to have to deal with multiple stories, investigate interesting tangents, and build a complex world with a variety of actors. And, it was interesting enough to make it into the category of comics I really care about. From there I went hunting, and found myself enchanted with Mike Mignola's works. The Amazing Screw On Head was recommended to me and was revelatory. X-Factor I stumbled across in a collection of Marvel Civil War. Its deliberate noir style and seriousness with which action was presented grabbed me. It takes place after Marvel's House of M event, which I should hopefully understand more fully after having read the trade paper back.

In part the point of creating this space was to track my progress in trying to understand the medium of comics, as well as my wishful attempts to start creating. More on this soon.
