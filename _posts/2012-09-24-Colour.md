I've been getting back to using my tablet again, and I'm trying to figure out colour. I'm
still having a decent amount of trouble with it, but having more fun with it.

I've started doing simple warm ups before I start drawing with the tablet also. I lay down
a bunch of random straight lines, and try to draw circles filling the areas created, trying
make as close to a circle as possible, with a clean join where the line meets back with
itself. It takes a good few tries to get each circle right, but I feel like I'm getting
more comfortable with the tablet.
