I was away with the family for the last few days on the Shannon. I'd read before that it 
was a good idea to draw instead of use the camera when on holidays, just for the sake of
practice. I tried it while I was away, doing quick sketches when I could. I'm really glad
I did, and will be doing so again. I've put the lot of them up on my 
[sketchbook](http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showpost.php?p=3505124&postcount=15). 
They're very rough, and they not pretty but I think they were very good practice.
