I got a few hours of drawing in today, and I tried to do a portrait in black and white. Putting a fork in 
this one, though a few more hours could definitely have sharpened it up. I'm happy enough with it though.
Things are definitely coming along. I wanted to work on painting without relying on lines to convey
shape, and I think that was successful enough.

I'm enjoying this more and more as I grow in confidence. It's incredibly rewarding. I've been working with a
Bamboo Pen & Touch and Sketchbook Pro. I've gotten used to using the tablet. For the longest time I would
find the fact that there wasn't a visible connection between hand->pen->paper->line incredibly disorienting,
and I'd move back to paper. Having just forced myself to use the tablet for a while, I no longer find
it strange and am really happy with the digital set-up.

I've got a growing list of things I want to try next, things that I just wouldn't have considered at all 
previously. I'm tossing up between a landscape and another portrait to try digital inking. 

Though, I watched Indie Game: The Movie twice in the last week. Guess I'm going to have to spend 4 years 
making an indie game now. I don't see how I have much choice... But seriously, if I can think of a game
that will allow me to develop drawing/painting skills I'll be all over it.
