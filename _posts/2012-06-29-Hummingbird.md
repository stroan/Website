Work had its first Hack Day today. A day to work on any projects we wanted, and then to show them off
at the end of the day. I decided to draw the company's Hummingbird mascot, instead of programming
something as I'd initially planned on doing. I was afraid it would be embarrassingly bad, but it
turned out much better than I'd expected. I may even put it up on my otherwise empty dA account :P
