I've been doing a lot of practice recently. Mostly I've been working through the first few plates
of Drawing the Head and Hands by Andrew Loomis. In between those I've been doing the occassional
painting practice. I posted this in the comments of a sketchbook update, but I have no idea how
to paint at all. I did this eye today, which I think turned out well enough.
