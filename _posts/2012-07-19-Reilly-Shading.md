I came across this [tutorial](http://www.freshdesigner.com/how-to-draw-head-quick-sketch-video/) on
Reilly Shading today while browsing [artsypopses.com](http://artsyposes.com). It's a neat method, and
I tried to apply it to a few reference photos from the site after watching it. I'll have to apply it
a few more times but it seems to give a good appraoch to understanding value.

I also went to the park and drew in public today. I should definitely do that more, it was extremely
difficult. A good place to practice gesture drawing I think, because you only get a few seconds of
people standing still.
