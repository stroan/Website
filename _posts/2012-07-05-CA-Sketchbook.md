I've started a [sketchbook](http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?p=3495923) on ConceptArt.org.
It's a website I've been reading for years. It's full of amazing artists, and I've waited until I was
slightly more confident before I was willing to post there. I'll be throwing all my studies and sketches 
up there, and cross-posting the better pieces here.
