I've been getting a lot more drawing in of late. Been cutting back on playing computer games in
favour of practicing and reading and I've been much happier doing so. I've decided to try my
hand at the current Create of the Week competition on conceptart.org. The theme is "Front Line 
Assault Beast". Below is an idea I was working on thisevening for it before I realized I'd not
read the requirements closely enough.

    The males of this docile species sport massive bone-y plates on their 
    heads. These plates are a used in their mating ritual, where males 
    charge at each other head on until one male forfeits. These plates grew 
    larger and the male's legs got stronger in order to charge more
    effectively. These traits of speed and hardiness make these creatures 
    perfect cannon fodder for the first wave of assault against entrenched 
    positions. They are made to charge towards the enemy with explosives 
    strapped to their underbellies. These explosives then detonate, 
    killing both the animal and anyone in the trench below.

UPDATE: Dabbled at painting it
