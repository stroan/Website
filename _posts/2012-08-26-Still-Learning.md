I've been drawing away, getting very slowly better. I'm in the middle of the essentials course at Vilppu Academy, and online correspondance art course. I've found it extremely challenging and simultaneously encouraging and disheartening. The course is giving me the tools to progress with learning independantly once its finished, and the critique of the exercises is incredibly valuable. But it's definitely putting my progress in perspective, and highlighting how incredibly far I have yet to go.

After the first week I was relatively disheartened. I'd really not put enough time into the exercise and the critique was as deserved. I have a lasting impression that art is about quickly dashing your brush against the page in a fit of emotion followed by quickly relighting a cheap cigarette in a dirty paris appartment and heading out to meet your fellow art-friends in the dirtiest cafe available within a four minute walk to discuss how difficult life is. 

Turns out drawing is precise, and careful, and requires long periods of focus. I'd never spent hours and hours on single drawings before, because I never had an external person who was going to hold me to a high standard and let me know exactly how I fell short of expextations. It's wonderful :)
