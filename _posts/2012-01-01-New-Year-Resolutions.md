I need to publicize my resolutions to make them real. A magic motivation comes from knowing others will be aware if I have failed. So:

* Stop eating out for lunch in work. Soup and sandwiches will be better for me, I'm sure of it. And carrots improve night vision and are much tastier than sausages. I need to believe. 
* Cut one undesirable food from my diet for a month, each month. No freezer pizza in January. Hopefully I'll learn how to cook eventually.
* At least an hour of creative hobbies each evening, unless not at home or otherwise engaged. Initial thinking is a half an hour for writing, and half an hour for drawing. This is just a minimum though, to aid in the development of a habit.
* A post here at least once a week, containing a least one drawing or piece of writing from the previous week.
* No games in an evening until the above has been met.

There may be more. But these seem like a reasonable set of rules for the coming months. 

Also, an interesting link I was given by my girlfriend on [practice](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/12/23/flow-is-the-opiate-of-the-medicore-advice-on-getting-better-from-an-accomplished-piano-player/).
I need to take this on board. I don't have any particular areas of competence in either writing or drawing. I'm not sure how much direction to approach
these tasks with. Do I set the goal to be Warren Ellis in a few years? Should I be thinking no further ahead than what I'm working on right at this minute.
I over-think these things. Bookshelves full of art books and empty sketchbooks can attest to that. 

Tomorrow, an hour of creation. We'll see what happens.
