It works! My sketchbook is surprisingly quickly turning into something I'm not completely ashamed of. 

One thing I learned a long time ago with programming was how to learn to program. Knowing what routine to go through to learn a new skill is important to be able to quickly acquire new programming skills. I'm very slowly getting an idea of what that process looks like for drawing. I have a set of tools at my disposal now. I have figure drawing from photographs, studies from figure drawing books, and trying to reproduce some of my favorite frames from the comics I'm reading. This is a small, and very incomplete, set of tools, but I'm beginning to see the framework into which these tools will fit.

Lacking from this are any tools for dealing with still lifes, and landscapes, and a whole wide range of other important areas of study. But figure drawing is my primary motivator, so I'll stick with that for now. 

I've not been writing the last few days, as I've been spending my time drawing. I think I'll have to fiddle with the writing rules for the coming months. Instead of a fixed time of writing, a goal number of words to write a week may make more sense. That'd let me mull over a short story for a week, and then spend a day at it over the weekend, or do a week of exercises, or whatever takes my fancy.
