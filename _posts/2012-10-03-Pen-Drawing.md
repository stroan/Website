In secondary school I drew a lot with pens. I've only been using pencils, and other "real"
media, recently in an attempt to get better. Not sure if that was the right focus. The last
few days, I've just been having fun with the drawing recently, trying not to get stuck up 
on what's going to push me forward the quickest. So I've been using a pen again, and having 
lots of fun. Did the following thisevening, based on a piece of Torchlight II 
[concept art](http://static.cms.runicgames.com//assets/141/TL2CoverB_1024x768.jpg).

And a small doodle I did last night from imagination.
